# Recipe App Frontend - Environment Variables (example)
# Copy this file to `.env` and adjust values as needed.
# CRA will only expose variables to the browser that are prefixed with REACT_APP_.

# Base API URL used by the API client. If empty, the client falls back to a deterministic in-memory mock.
# Examples:
#   http://localhost:4000
#   https://api.example.com
REACT_APP_API_BASE=

# Deprecated/alternate backend base URL used as a secondary fallback if REACT_APP_API_BASE is not set.
# If both are empty, the API client uses local mock data and/or MSW test server.
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=

# Public URL where the frontend is hosted. Generally not required; CRA will infer.
# Set when generating absolute links or when other services need to know the frontend origin.
# Example: http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# WebSocket base URL for real-time features. Not currently used by this app,
# but provided for forward-compatibility. Example: ws://localhost:4000
REACT_APP_WS_URL=

# Explicit node env override used within the app where needed (tests also check this).
# Allowed: development | test | production
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=development

# Disables Next.js telemetry in monorepos/CI if Next.js tooling exists.
# Not used by CRA itself but kept for consistency across environments.
REACT_APP_NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Enable source maps for production builds if desired.
# CRA controls sourcemaps via GENERATE_SOURCEMAP; we mirror this for consistency.
# Set to "true" to enable. In CI you may prefer disabling for smaller bundles.
REACT_APP_ENABLE_SOURCE_MAPS=true

# Development server port for `npm start`. CRA defaults to 3000.
# Change if 3000 is occupied. Example: 5173
REACT_APP_PORT=3000

# Whether to trust proxy headers (X-Forwarded-*) in hosting environments (for future SSR setups).
# Not used directly by this SPA but retained for parity with typical setups.
REACT_APP_TRUST_PROXY=false

# Client-side log level. Not wired to a logger by default, but may be read by future logging utility.
# Allowed values: trace | debug | info | warn | error | silent
REACT_APP_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Healthcheck path to use for container orchestration or readiness checks.
# If your hosting pings a path, expose a static route or asset to respond 200.
REACT_APP_HEALTHCHECK_PATH=/healthz

# Comma-separated feature flags. The app currently reads REACT_APP_EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED,
# but this provides a generic place for feature toggles for future use.
# Example: search-new,telemetry-off
REACT_APP_FEATURE_FLAGS=

# Boolean to enable experiments that may append "exp=1" to requests when API is configured.
# Values: true | false
REACT_APP_EXPERIMENTS_ENABLED=false
